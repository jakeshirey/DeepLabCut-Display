# DeepLabCut-Display
A GUI for displaying landmark data from DeepLabCut Models for animal locomotion.

This tool is meant to compliment the output of a DeepLabCut inference and allow a video with landmark annotations to be displayed with a plot of the coordinates of the landmark points. 

DeepLabCut is a package for markerless pose estimation of animals using deep learning models. The Github repository for this package can be found here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut

This complimentary tool was originally developed for the University of Florida Department of Animal Sciences to display locomotion data from livestock ranging from beef heifers to sport horses.
